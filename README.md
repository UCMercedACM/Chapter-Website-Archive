# ACM @ UC Merced's Archived Chapter Website

This repo serves to host the old legacy code used in the original production version. The repo only
exists in order to provide an reference for the modern and current website. If you wish to look
at the original version, you can find it on the [`react` branch](https://github.com/UCMercedACM/Chapter-Website/tree/react)
of the main repo.

Something to note is that this project uses Yarn, and uses [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). The production
hosted version on Firebase can be found [here](https://acm-chapter-website.web.app/).

For those who worked on this project, you will still be remembered.
